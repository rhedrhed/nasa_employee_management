The “Introduction to GitHub” lab task had provided us the foundational knowledge to further advance our technical endeavors.


# What did you learn about GitHub and project planning?

As we simulated a working solution for NASA’s HR department when it comes to employee management, we were tested on our project management skills and familiarity with GitHub. 
Furthermore, as we continued to simulate potential issues with our new implementation including their appropriate labels, descriptions, and task assignment. 

# What was challenging or fun? If you had more time, what would you improve?

The lab was of appropriate difficulty due to our prior experience of using GitHub for a Hackathon we’ve previously participated in. 
The challenges involved simulating realistic/practical issues for us to tackle as programmers for this newly implemented system; although it was simultaneously enjoyable as it exercised our critical thinking skills. 

# Ideas for imrpovement
Sequentially, our ideas for improvement in our employee management system include the addition of providing tasks such as updating the system UI instead of solely focusing on assigning issues to be resolved to be able to maximize the collaborative capabilities of GitHub.
